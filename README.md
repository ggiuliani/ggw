# Great Green Wall (GGW)
This is the JavaScript code implementation of the African Great Green Wall analysis using the Google Earth Engine [GEE](https://earthengine.google.com).

The [full analysis script](gee_ggw.js) generates NDVI & precipitation time-series per country together with zonal statistics and trend analysis at different spatial scales.

NDVI data are produced from Landsat data.

The methodology and results are presented in the following (submitted) paper:
